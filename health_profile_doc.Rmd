The population structure of the City of Moonee Valley is not forecast to change greatly between 2020 and 2040. However, there will be an increase the population of all age groups. There will be a slight increase in the median age and a greater proportion of older residents. This population increase will require an expansion of service provision to meet the needs of all these people. 

```{r, fig.height=4.25, fig.width=7}

By neighbourhood, we can see that the highest proportions of those aged 65 years and over are in Milleara and Avondale Heights. Aberfeldie and Flemington have the highest proportions of young people.

## Cultural and linguistic diversity (Indigenous language)

### Indigenous population

At the 2016 Census, there were 430 residents who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. This was equal to 0.4 per cent of the Moonee Valley population at the time and is similar to neighbouring municipalities (0.5 per cent in both Moreland and in Maribyrnong). Census data also shows other differences between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous population in Moonee Valley:

* a lower median age (28 years) for the indigenous population compared to the non-Indigenous population (38 years)
* lower Year 12 completion rate (53 per cent compared to 66 per cent)
* a higher proportion renting (59 per cent compared to 32 per cent)

### Languages spoken at home (Indigenous language)

The most common languages spoken at home (other than English) by residents of the City of Moonee Valley are Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese and Arabic.

### Proficiency in spoken English

Those who spoke Hindi at home were more likely to also have good levels of spoken English. Census data shows that for Moonee Valley residents, for the most common languages other than English, those who spoke Hindi, Maltese, and Turkish were the most likely to also speak English 'Very well'.

### Multiculturalism makes Moonee Valley a better place to live

Data from the Moonee Valley Community Survey shows that about six in ten residents value the multiculturalism in Moonee Valley. This was higher amongst females than males, and also higher in areas like Flemington and Ascot Vale where the population is more culturally diverse.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2}

## Education

Data from the 2016 Census shows that about 30 per cent of Moonee Valley residents are attending an educational institution. About 24 per cent of these were in primary school, while 20 per cent were in secondary school and 26 per cent were in a tertiary or technical institution. A lower proportion of primary school students are in government schools (10.9 per cent) when compared to Greater Melbourne (16.8 per cent).

## Self-reported health

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that about 47.5 per cent of Moonee Valley residents reported either 'excellent' or 'very good' health. This is higher than for Victoria and the Western Melbourne Area (approximately 42 per cent).

Data from the various Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) indices show that overall Moonee Valley is fairly well advantaged when we compare it to other local government areas in Victoria. Moonee Valley is in ninth decile (ten equal groups, with decile 1 being the most disadvantaged) for the Index of Education and Occupation  and the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage. Moonee Valley is also in the eighth decile on the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage and the seventh decile for the  Index of Economic Resources.

However, the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD) also shows that there is great economic diversity in Moonee Valley households. Here the scores are split in to deciles (each comprising ten per cent of scores, with decile 1 being the most disadvantaged). There are pockets of disadvantage in neighbourhoods like Flemington, Ascot Vale, Avondale Heights and Milleara with many area in the most disadvantaged deciles. In contrast, Strathmore and Strathmore Heights are the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods with all of the population in the least disadvantaged deciles. Some areas in Flemington and Ascot vale (the public housing estates) are some of the most disadvantaged in Victoria.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width=7}
ggplot(irsd_nh, aes(decile, prop)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#E55048") + facet_wrap(~nh, nrow =4) + theme(legend.position="none") +

This disparity disadvantage is shown in the map below. The greatest concentrations of disadvantage in Moonee Valley are one the public housing estates in Flemington and Ascot Vale.

Data from the 2016 Census shows that females do more unpaid work (housework), while having lower incomes and being less likely to participate in the labour force. The labour force participation rate is the proportion of the population aged 15 years and over that are in the labour force (i.e. either in work, or looking for work).

## Tenure type

About two-thirds of dwellings are owned in Moonee Valley. Of these, 35 per cent are owned outright, while 29 per cent are owned with a mortgage. Another 32.5 per cent of homes are rented (of the rented dwellings, about 14 per cent are social housing).

## Affordable housing

According to the Rental Report from the Department of Health and Human Services, there were only 21 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley in June 2020. These are private rental properties (newly leased) affordable to households on statutory (Centrelink) incomes by bedroom number. There have been fewer than 30 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley since 2015.

## Homelessness

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows show little change in the number of homeless persons in Moonee Valley between 2011 and 2016. Across the country, the number of homeless persons has risen, but in Moonee Valley, there was a slight decline, with 403 homeless persons in 2016, compared to 409 in 2011. The figure for 2016 (403 persons) is 1.6 per cent of the all homeless persons in Victoria (24,828).

# Community Safety (Indigenous language)

Data from the Council's annual community survey shows that about 45 per cent of all residents feel safe walking alone in their local area at night. About eight in ten residents feel safe at public transport stops and stations, while about nine in ten residents feel safe when walking alone in their local area during the day.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
cs_safety <- read_csv("data_in/community_survey/safety_full_2020.csv")

Perceptions of safety of walking alone in the local area at night are much lower for females than for males. In 2020, only 38 per cent of females reported feeling either 'very safe' or 'safe' compared to 54 per cent for males. There is little difference between males and females for perceptions of safety at public transport stops as well as walking alone during the day.

# Employment (include Woi-wurrung language) 

## Employment type

Data from the 2016 Census shows that there are similar employment levels in Moonee Valley when compared to Greater Melbourne. About 60 per cent of those in the labour force work full time, while about 30 per cent work part time.

## Occupation

Data from the 2016 Census shows that about 29 per cent of Moonee Valley residents work in professional jobs, with another 15 per cent in managerial positions. This compares to 25 per cent and 13 per cent respectively for Greater Melbourne. The next most common occupation types are clerical and administrative workers, technicians and trades workers, sales workers, and community services workers.

* Health care and Social Assistance (11.3 per cent of those employed)
* Education and training (10.3 per cent)
* Professional, Scientific and Technical Services (10.2 per cent)
* Retail Trade (9.5 per cent)

These top four industries are the same (in a different order) as for Greater Melbourne.

## People experiencing unemployment (Indigenous language)

The unemployment rate in the City of Moonee Valley has generally been lower than the rate for Greater Melbourne. The dataset runs to March 2020 and only reflects the impacts from the pandemic social restrictions.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
# import from economic tracker
salm_raw <- read_csv("data_in/salm_chart_rate_data.csv") 

salm_mv <- salm_raw %>% 
  filter(region %in% c("City of Moonee Valley", "Greater Melbourne")) 

ggplot(salm_mv, aes(date, values, colour = region, label = values)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() + ylim(3.5, 7.5) +

  geom_text_repel(data = salm_mv %>% filter(date == as.Date("2020-03-01")), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Moonee Valley's unemployment rate is generally low",
       x = NULL, y = "Unemployment rate (%)", colour = NULL,
       caption = "Source: Small Area Labour Markets, Department of Education, Skills and Employment, 2020")
ggsave("graphs_out/unemployment_rate.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

The unemployment rate is highest in Flemington and Ascot Vale and lowest in Strathmore.

```{r}
salm_sa2 <- salm_raw %>%

```

While the unemployment rate across the municipality has generally remained lower that of Greater Melbourne, women, young people and those aged 70 years and over have experienced the greatest job losses since the pandemic began. Job losses across these groups could be explained by the fact that women and young people make up a greater proportion of the Accommodation and Food Services as well as the Retail Trade sectors which were hardest hit when by the pandemic. 

Shelley to add more narrative around women and young people – mental health, caring duties, gender inequality. Predicted stunt to entering workforce !!!

## Healthy eating and food security

Looking at the locations of supermarkets and (the larger) fast food outlets, we can see that they are spread across the municipality with concentrations in the activity centres, however, there are also a number of outlets near the Flemington public housing estate.

![](maps/supermarkets.png)

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey shows that only 3.2 per cent of Moonee Valley residents met the fruit and vegetable consumption guidelines, though the margin of error for this indicator is large.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_fvi <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_fvi.csv") %>%  # self reported dental health status

### Estimates for diabetes

The Australian Health Policy Collaboration estimates that the rate of diabetes in Moonee Valley (3.7 per cent) is lower than for Greater Melbourne (4.1 per cent). Based on their modelled estimates, about 2,260 people in Moonee Valley have diabetes.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5}

diabetes_est <- tibble(
            region = c("Moonee Valley (C)", "Greater Melbourne"),

### Tests for chronic disease

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that testing for chronic disease in Moonee Valley is similar to levels in Western Melbourne. Bowel examinations are lower, and faecal blood occult tests are higher than for Western Melbourne, though these differences are not statistically significant.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
vphs_blood <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_blood.csv") %>%  # blood tests

## Modifiable risk factors (Indigenous language)

### Smoking

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that smoking levels in Moonee Valley are similar to those in Western Melbourne and Victoria. About 15 per cent of the Moonee Valley residents are current smokers.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_smoking <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_smoking.csv")

ggplot(vphs_smoking, aes(fct_rev(region), pct, fill = region)) + 
  theme_pubclean() + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill="#fafafa")) + 
  geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul, width=.1)) + facet_wrap(~selections, ncol = 3) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = pct, y = 7), col = "white", fontface = "bold") +

       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)", caption = "Source: DHHS, Victorian Population Health Survey, 2017")
ggsave("graphs_out/smoking.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

Smoking levels are higher for men (17 per cent), than for women (14 per cent), though again the confidence interval is quite large.

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=7}
# Current smoker (daily + occasional) by age
vphs_smoking_gender <- tibble(

### Alcohol

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that Moonee Valley residents are more likely to have increased alcohol related harm when compared to Western Melbourne and Victoria. This is true for both lifetime risk of alcohol-related harm, as well as for alcohol related harm from a single occasion of drinking.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_alcohol <- tibble(
                       region = c("Moonee Valley","Western Melbourne Area","Victoria",
                                  "Moonee Valley","Western Melbourne Area","Victoria"),
           pct = c(64.2, 54.6, 59.5, 46.6, 39.5, 43.0),
                ll = c(58.5, 51.6, 58.6, 40.73, 36.69, 42.11),
                ul = c(69.5, 57.5, 60.4, 52.66, 42.37, 43.87),
                         selections = c(rep("Increased lifetime risk of \nalcohol-related harm", 3),
                                        rep("Increased risk of alcohol-related \nharm from a single occasion \nof drinking", 3))
)

ggsave("graphs_out/alcohol.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

Both on-licence (such as restaurants and pubs) and off-licence (such as bottle shops) alcohol outlets are generally located in activity centres in Moonee Valley. These are most concentrated in the east of the municipality.  There are few on-license outlets in the western part of the municipality.

![](maps/Alcohol map layout.png)

Data from Turning Point shows that there were over 600 alcohol related hospital admissions for Moonee Valley residents in 2018-19. The majority of these were males, who were admitted at twice the rate of females.

Moonee Valley has a higher rate of alcohol related hospitalisations than many other local government areas in the North West region, though it is not the highest. 

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}

### Drugs

```{r}
hosp_adm_drugs <- read_csv("data_in/aodstats/illicit_drugs_hosp_admissions.csv", skip = 2) %>%

  mutate(group = str_replace(group, "_", "-"))

hosp_adm_drugs_gend <- hosp_adm_drugs %>% 
  filter(group %in% c("Male", "Female"))
```

Data from Turning Point shows that there were over 300 illicit drugs related hospital admissions for Moonee Valley residents in 2018-19. The majority of these were males. Similar to trends in alcohol, males were admitted to hospital at 1.6 times the rate of females.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}

ggsave("graphs_out/drugs_hospitalisation_gender.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

Moonee Valley has a higher rate of illicit drugs related hospitalisations than many other local government areas in the North West region, though it is not the highest. Alarmingly, it can also be seen that illicit drug related hospitalisations for both males and females have been increasing steadily since 2012, more than doubling for males, and almost doubling for females.

### Gambling

Data from the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation shows that over `$77.6 million` was spent on pokies in Moonee Valley in 2018-19, equating to `$212,742` per day across 11 venues with pokies.

![](images/gambling-in-victoria-moonee-valley.png)

In a usual year, almost `$80 million` is lost through pokies in the City of Moonee Valley. However, this figure was only `$58 million` in the 2019-20 financial year as pokies venues have been closed temporarily due to COVID-19.

### Obesity

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that the almost half (48 per cent) of Moonee Valley residents are overweight. This is similar to the proportion in the Western Melbourne Area and slightly lower than the rate for Victoria (51 per cent).

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_obese <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_obese.csv") # overweight (pre-obese or obese)

vphs_ggplot_function(dataset = vphs_obese, yval = 2, title_text = "About half of the adult population who are overweight",
                     subtitle_text = "Pre-obese or obese based on BMI")

```

Residents in Moonee Valley have lower consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages with 6.4 per cent of residents consuming these drinks daily, compared to 10.1 per cent for Victoria and 10.8 per cent for the Western Melbourne Area. Moonee Valley residents also consume takeaway snacks or meals less often when compared against both Western Melbourne and Victoria.

### Immunisation

Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that within the postcode areas of Moonee Valley, the immunisation rate for one year olds is highest in the 3033, 3034, 3040 and 3041 postcodes. Immunisation rates are lower for two year olds. The immunisation rate is highest for five year olds in the 3039, 3041 and 3042 postcodes.

### Physical activity

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that approximately 58 per cent of Moonee Valley residents complied with the physical activity guidelines, compared to 48.5 per cent in the Western Melbourne Area. Approximately 30 per cent of residents spent seven or more hours sitting on an average weekday, higher than both the Western Melbourne Area (28 per cent) and Victoria (27 per cent).

## Mental health  (Indigenous language)

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that approximately eight in ten residents rated their feeling of life being worthwhile (79 per cent) and life satisfaction (78 per cent) as ‘very high’ or ‘high’.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_lifesat <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_lifesat.csv") %>% 
  filter(region == "Moonee Valley") %>% 
  mutate(type = "Life satisfaction")
vphs_worthwhile <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_worthwhile.csv") %>%

vphs_mhw <- bind_rows(vphs_lifesat, vphs_worthwhile) %>% 
  mutate(selections = factor(selections, levels = c("Low or medium (0-6)", "High (7-8)", "Very high (9-10)")))

ggplot(vphs_mhw, aes(selections, pct, fill = type)) +

ggsave("graphs_out/mental_wellbeing.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

The Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 also shows that approximately 30 per cent of Moonee Valley residents had ever been diagnosed with anxiety of depression. This figure is higher than both Western Melbourne (25 per cent) and Victoria (27 per cent).

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_anx <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_anx.csv") # anxiety or depression

vphs_ggplot_function(dataset = vphs_anx, yval = 2, title_text = "Higher levels of anxiety or depression") +
  labs(subtitle = "Proportion of adults ever diagnosed with anxiety or depression")
ggsave("graphs_out/anxiety_depression.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

Looking at the data by sex, the 2017 survey also shows that males in Moonee Valley were more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression, but were less likely to seek professional help for mental health problems than females.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
# Feeling of life being worthwhile
vphs_mh_gender_life <- tibble(gender = c("Males","Females"),
       pct = c(33.4, 26.8),

  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = c("Moonee Valley (C)", "Greater Melbourne"))) %>% 
  mutate(prem_deaths = round(prem_deaths, 1))

death_causes <- read_excel("data_in/death_data_aihw.xlsx", sheet = "deaths_cleaner", range = "A20:F40") %>%

```

```{r}

  geom_text_repel(data = death_prem %>% filter(year == 2018), show.legend = FALSE)
ggsave("graphs_out/premature_death.eps") # eps for illustrator 
```

## Top causes of death

```{r}
# Top ten causes of death in the City of Moonee Valley, 2018
death_causes_data <- death_causes %>% 
  select(cause_of_death, deaths, per_cent_of_all_causes) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  mutate(per_cent_of_all_causes = round(per_cent_of_all_causes, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(deaths = round(deaths, 1)) %>% 
  rename(`Cause` = cause_of_death, Deaths = deaths, `Per cent of all causes` = per_cent_of_all_causes)

death_causes_data %>% 
  flextable()  %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  add_header_lines(values = "Top ten causes of death in Moonee Valley, 2018") %>% 
  theme_vanilla() %>% 
  footnote( i = 1, j = 1:3,
            value = as_paragraph(
              c("Source: AIHW, Mortality over Regions and Time, 2020")
            ),
            ref_symbols = c(""),
            part = "header")
```

Leading underlying causes of death by age - add to narrative !!!

As well as differences by sex, the leading causes of death also vary by age. Chronic diseases feature more prominently among people aged 45 and over, while the leading causes of death among people aged 1–44 are external causes, such as accidents and suicides (Figure 3.2).
