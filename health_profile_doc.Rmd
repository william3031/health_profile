```

The population structure of the City of Moonee Valley is not forecast to change greatly between 2020 and 2040. There will be an increase in all age groups, though there will be a slight increase in the median age and a greater proportion of older residents.

```{r, fig.height=4.25, fig.width=7}

## Self-reported health

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that about 47.5 per cent of Moonee Valley residents reported either 'excellent' or 'very good' health. Thic compares to about 42 per cent for Victoria and the Western Melbourne Area.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
# function more just for single plots
vphs_ggplot_function <- function(dataset, title_text, yval = 2.5,  subtitle_text = NULL,
                                 caption_text = "Source: Victorian Population Health Survey, 2017"){

  geom_text(aes(label = pct, y = yval), col = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(title = title_text, subtitle = subtitle_text,
       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)",
       caption = caption_text)
}

vphs_srhealth <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_srhealth.csv") %>%  # anxiety or depression
  filter(selections == "Excellent / very good")

vphs_ggplot_function(dataset = vphs_srhealth, yval = 2, title_text = "Self-reported health",
                     subtitle_text = "Excellent or very good health status")
```

The same data shows that women in Moonee Valley were more likely to self-report higher levels of health than males.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_srh_gender <- tibble(
            gender = c("Women", "Women", "Women", "Men", "Men", "Men"),
         selection = c("Excellent/Very good","Good",
                       "Fair/Poor","Excellent/Very good","Good","Fair/Poor"),
               pct = c(53.7, 27.9, 18.2, 41.1, 42.3, 16.6),

# Environmental factors

## Socio-economic disadvantage

```{r}
irsd_raw <- read_csv("data_in/SEIFA2016IRSD.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(sa1 = sa1_7digit_code_2016, nh = neighbourhood, pop = usual_resident_population) %>%
  mutate(nh = str_to_title(nh)) %>%

#   left_join(irsd_raw, by = "sa1") %>% 
#   select(sa1, decile) %>% 
#   filter(!is.na(decile))
```

Data from the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD) shows that there is great economic diversity in Moonee Valley households. There are pockets of disadvantage in neighbourhoods like Flemington, Ascot Vale, Avondale Heights and Milleara. In contrast, Strathmore and Strathmore Heights are the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width=7}
ggplot(irsd_nh, aes(decile, prop)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#E55048") + facet_wrap(~nh, nrow =4) + theme(legend.position="none") +
  theme_pubclean() +
  labs(title = "SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD)",
       subtitle = "By neighbourhood", caption = "Data source: ABS, 2016 Census",
       x = "SEIFA IRSD decile (1 = most disadvantaged, 10 = least disadvantaged)", y = "Percentage of neighbourhood population") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(seq(1,10,1))) + scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```

This disparity is shown on the map below. The greatest concentrations of disadvantage are one the public housing estates in Flemington and Ascot Vale.

## Heat Vulnerability Index

The Heat Vulnerability Index measures the impact of the Urban Heat Island effect on vulnerable populations. Within Moonee Valley, the most vulnerable areas are in the east of the municipality, where there is a higher concentration of older adults.

```{r}

# Affordable housing

According to the Rental Report from the Department of Health and Human Services, there were 21 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley in June 2020. These are private rental properties (newly leased) affordable to households on statutory incomes by bedroom number. There have been fewer than 30 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley since 2015.

# Health Status

## Oral health

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey shows that Moonee Valley residents have better self-reported dental health, lower incidence of gum disease when compared to the Western Melbourne Area and Victoria. Moonee Valley residents are also less likely to delay visiting a dental professional because of cost when compared to Victoria.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}

### Tests for chronic disease

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that testing for chronic disease in Moonee Valley is similar to levels in Western Melbourne. Bowel examinations are lower, and faecal blood occult tests are higher than for Western Melbourne, but these differences are not statistically significant.

## Modifiable risk factors

### Smoking

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that smoking levels in Moonee Valley are similar to those in Western Melbourne and Victoria. About 15 per cent of the population are current smokers.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_smoking <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_smoking.csv")

ggplot(vphs_smoking, aes(fct_rev(region), pct, fill = region)) + 
  theme_pubclean() +
  geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul, width=.1)) + facet_wrap(~selections, ncol = 3) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = pct, y = 7), col = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + theme(legend.position = "none") + coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Smoking status", 
       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)", caption = "Source: Victorian Population Health Survey, 2017")
```

Smoking levels are higher for men, than for women, though again the confidence interval is quite large.

```{r}
# Current smoker (daily + occasional) by age
smoking_gender <- tibble(
            Gender = c("Women", "Men"),
               Percentage = c(14.2, 17),
                `Lower limit` = c(8.8, 11.2),
                `Upper limit` = c(22.1, 24.9))

            ),
            ref_symbols = c(""),
            part = "header")
```


### Alcohol

* AOD stats

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that Moonee Valley residents are more likely to have increased alcohol related harm when compared to Western Melbourne and Victoria. This is for both lifetime risk of alcohol-related harm, as well as for alcohol related harm from a single occasion of drinking.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_alcohol <- tibble(
                       region = c("Moonee Valley","Western Melbourne Area","Victoria",
                                  "Moonee Valley","Western Melbourne Area","Victoria"),
           pct = c(64.2, 54.6, 59.5, 46.6, 39.5, 43.0),
                ll = c(58.5, 51.6, 58.6, 40.73, 36.69, 42.11),
                ul = c(69.5, 57.5, 60.4, 52.66, 42.37, 43.87),
                         selections = c(rep("Increased lifetime risk of \nalcohol-related harm", 3),
                                        rep("Increased risk of alcohol-related \nharm from a single occasion \nof drinking", 3))
)

ggplot(vphs_alcohol, aes(fct_rev(region), pct, fill = region)) + 
  theme_pubclean() +
  geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul, width=.1)) + facet_wrap(~selections, ncol = 3) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = pct, y = 7), col = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + theme(legend.position = "none") + coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Alcohol consumption", 
       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)", caption = "Source: Victorian Population Health Survey, 2017")
```

On and off licence alcohol outlets are generally distributed in the activity centres in Moonee Valley. These are generally in the east of the city.

### Gambling

Data from the Victorian Responsible Gaming Foundation shows that over $77.6 million was spent on pokies in Moonee Valley in 2018-19.

![pokies chart](images/gambling-in-victoria-moonee-valley.png)

In a usual year, almost $80 million is lost at pokies in venues in the City of Moonee Valley.

```


When looking at the distribution of Electronic Gaming Machines in Moonee Valley, we can see that they are concentrated in the east of the municipality.

### Obesity

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that the proportion of residents who are overweight is similar to the proportion in the Western Melbourne Area.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}

                     subtitle_text = "Pre-obese or obese based on BMI")
```

Residents in Moonee Valley have lower consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages though; 6.4 per cent of residents consume these drinks daily.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}

```


### Physical activity

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that about 58 per cent of Moonee Valley residents complied with the physical activity, compared to 48.5 per cent in the Western Melbourne Area. About 30 per cent of residents spent 7 or more hours sitting on an average weekday.
