# Population

## Current and projected

```{r}
pop_hh_raw <- read_excel("data_in/Forecast.id update (December 2017 update).xlsx", sheet = "Population and households") %>% 
  clean_names()

mv_pop_hh <- pop_hh_raw %>% 
  filter(area == "City of Moonee Valley", data_type %in% c("Total Population", "Households"))
```

The population of the City of Moonee Valley is forecast to increase from about 130,000 in 2019, to around 170,000 in 2040.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}

  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(age_grp = age_group) %>% 
  mutate(age_grp = str_replace(age_grp, " years and over", " plus")) %>% 
  mutate(age_grp = str_replace(age_grp, " years", "")) %>% 
  mutate(age_grp = factor(age_grp, levels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24", "25-29", "30-34", "35-39", "40-44",
                                              "45-49", "50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85 plus"))) %>%

```

  mutate(per_cent = round(per_cent, 2)) %>% 
  mutate(per_cent_label = case_when(gender == "Female" ~ -per_cent,
                              TRUE ~ per_cent))
}

#data by neighbourhood
pp_nh_data <- function(selected_neighbourhood){

                              TRUE ~ per_cent))
}

```

The population structure of the City of Moonee Valley is not forecast to change greatly between 2020 and 2040. There will be an increase in all age groups, though there will be a slight increase in the median age and a greater proportion of older residents.

```{r, fig.height=4.25, fig.width=7}
pp_mv <- pp_nh_data("City of Moonee Valley") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2020, 2040))

ggplot(pp_mv, aes(age_grp, per_cent_label, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) + 
  theme_pubclean() + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill="#fafafa")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4), labels=c("4%", "2%", "0%", "2%", "4%")) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Percentage", fill = NULL,
       title = "City of Moonee Valley forecast population structure", subtitle = "Proportion of population by year (at 30 June)",
       caption = "Data source: .id consulting, Moonee Valley Population Forecasts, 2017") + 
  facet_wrap(~factor(year), ncol = 8) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

This will see population increases in all age groups and will increase the need for service provision to meet the needs of all these people.

```{r}
# with numbers
pp_mv2 <- pp_mv %>% 
  mutate(number_label = if_else(gender == "Male", number, -number))

ggplot(pp_mv2, aes(age_grp, number_label, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) + 
  theme_pubclean() + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill="#fafafa")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-6000, -3000, 0, 3000, 6000), labels=c("6,000", "3,000", "0", "3,000", "6,000")) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Population", fill = NULL, title = "City of Moonee Valley forecast population structure",
       subtitle = "Population by year (at 30 June)",
       caption = "Data source: .id consulting, Moonee Valley Population Forecasts, 2017") + 
  facet_wrap(~factor(year), ncol = 8) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```



By neighbourhood, we can see that the highest proportions of those aged 65 years and over are in Milleara and Avondale Heights. Aberfeldie and Flemington have the highest proportions of young people.

## Cultural and linguistic diversity

### Indigenous population

At the 2016 Census, there were 430 residents who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. This was 0.4 per cent of the Moonee Valley population at the time. Census data also shows other differences between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populiation in Moonee Valley:

* a lower median age (28 years) than for the non-Indigenous population (38 years)
* lower Year 12 completion rate (53 per cent compared to 66 per cent)
* a higher proportion renting (59 per cent compared to 32 per cent)

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=2}

       caption = "Source: ABS, Census 2016")
```

### Languages spoken at home

The top languages spoken at home (other than English) by residents of the City of Moonee Valley are Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Cantonese.

```{r}
lanp_2016 <- read_csv("data_in/MV_LANP_2016.csv", skip = 10) %>%

### Proficiency in spoken English

Census data shows that for Moonee Valley residents, for the most common languages other than English, those who spoke Hindi, Maltese, and Turkish were the most likely to self-assess that they spoke English 'Very well'.

```{r}
lanp_engp_2016_raw <- read_csv("data_in/MV_LANP_by_ENGP_2016.csv", skip = 10) %>%

```

## Self-reported health

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that about 47.5 per cent of Moonee Valley residents reported either 'excellent' or 'very good' health. This compares to about 42 per cent for Victoria and the Western Melbourne Area.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
# function more just for single plots

  geom_text(aes(label = pct, y = yval), col = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mv2040_cols) + theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(title = title_text, subtitle = subtitle_text,
       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)",
       caption = caption_text)
}

vphs_srhealth <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_srhealth.csv") %>%  # anxiety or depression
  filter(selections == "Excellent / very good")

vphs_ggplot_function(dataset = vphs_srhealth, yval = 2, title_text = "Self-reported health",
                     subtitle_text = "Excellent or very good health status")
```

The same data shows that women in Moonee Valley were more likely to self-report higher levels of health than males.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_srh_gender <- tibble(
            gender = c("Women", "Women", "Women", "Men", "Men", "Men"),
         selection = c("Excellent/Very good","Good",
                       "Fair/Poor","Excellent/Very good","Good","Fair/Poor"),
               pct = c(53.7, 27.9, 18.2, 41.1, 42.3, 16.6),
                ll = c(46, 21.8, 13.2, 32.7, 33.9, 11),

Data from the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD) shows that there is great economic diversity in Moonee Valley households. There are pockets of disadvantage in neighbourhoods like Flemington, Ascot Vale, Avondale Heights and Milleara. In contrast, Strathmore and Strathmore Heights are the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width=7}
ggplot(irsd_nh, aes(decile, prop)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#E55048") + facet_wrap(~nh, nrow =4) + theme(legend.position="none") +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(seq(1,10,1))) + scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```

This disparity is shown on the map below. The greatest concentrations of disadvantage are one the public housing estates in Flemington and Ascot Vale.

## Heat Vulnerability Index

The Heat Vulnerability Index measures the impact of the Urban Heat Island effect on vulnerable populations. Within Moonee Valley, the most vulnerable areas are in the east of the municipality, where there is a higher concentration of older adults.

# Affordable housing

According to the Rental Report from the Department of Health and Human Services, there were 21 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley in June 2020. These are private rental properties (newly leased) affordable to households on statutory incomes by bedroom number. There have been fewer than 30 affordable lettings in Moonee Valley since 2015.

# Community Safety

Data from the Community Survey shows that about less than half of all residents feel safe walking alone in their local area at night. About 80 per cent feel safe at public transport stops and stations, while almost all residents feel safe when walking alone in their local area during the day.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}

### Tests for chronic disease

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that testing for chronic disease in Moonee Valley is similar to levels in Western Melbourne. Bowel examinations are lower, and faecal blood occult tests are higher than for Western Melbourne, but these differences are not statistically significant.

## Modifiable risk factors

### Smoking

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that smoking levels in Moonee Valley are similar to those in Western Melbourne and Victoria. About 15 per cent of the population are current smokers.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
vphs_smoking <- read_csv("data_in/vphs/vphs_smoking.csv")

ggplot(vphs_smoking, aes(fct_rev(region), pct, fill = region)) + 
  theme_pubclean() + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill="#fafafa")) + 
  geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul, width=.1)) + facet_wrap(~selections, ncol = 3) +

  labs(title = "Smoking status", 
       x = NULL, y = "Percentage (with 95% CI)", caption = "Source: DHHS, Victorian Population Health Survey, 2017")

### Alcohol

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that Moonee Valley residents are more likely to have increased alcohol related harm when compared to Western Melbourne and Victoria. This is for both lifetime risk of alcohol-related harm, as well as for alcohol related harm from a single occasion of drinking.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}

### Gambling

Data from the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation shows that over $77.6 million was spent on pokies in Moonee Valley in 2018-19.

![pokies chart](images/gambling-in-victoria-moonee-valley.png)

In a usual year, almost $80 million is lost at pokies in venues in the City of Moonee Valley. This of course has been reduced as pokies venues have been closed temporarily  due to COVID-19.

### Obesity

Data from the Victorian Population Health Survey 2017 shows that the proportion of residents who are overweight is similar to the proportion in the Western Melbourne Area.
